## Installation
R can easily be installed from [R Download Link]. The installer is then run and R is setup in our systems.
Then we download the professional code editor for R Programming Language [RStudio]. Once installed, running the installer can easily setup RStudio and made functional.

## Sample Code
Once the setup is complete we can easily write our first R code to understand the smooth functioning of R in our systems.
```r
x <- 11
print(x)
typeof(x)
```
The output obtained somewhat looks like:

```bash
[1] 10
[2] "double"
```
